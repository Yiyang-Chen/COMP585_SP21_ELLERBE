# 1.Unity
This is a unity project, we use version **2019.4.22f1**

When you download the unity, remember to choose **Android/IOS support (SDK, NDK, JDK)**, so that the project can be built to cell phone.



# 2.Vuforia
After add your project to unity hub, you need to download Vuforia.

Go to [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OtJ0-zajURqmgdKsyYFLzw9nguwTvT2O?usp=sharing)

Download the folder Vuforia.

Put the folder under **Packages/package**

Some part of the Vuforia is already included in this github. If you install vuforia from official website without having that folder in the right place, there might be errors.
