  description: "The great blue heron (Ardea herodias) is a large wading bird in the
    heron family Ardeidae, common near the shores of open water and in wetlands over
    most of North America and Central America, as well as the Caribbean and the Gal\xE1pagos
    Islands. It is a rare vagrant to coastal Spain, the Azores, and areas of far
    southern Europe. An all-white population found in south Florida and the Florida
    Keys is known as the great white heron. Debate exists about whether this represents
    a white color morph of the great blue heron, a subspecies of it, or an entirely
    separate species. The status of white individuals known to occur elsewhere in
    the Caribbean, and very rarely elsewhere in eastern North America, is unclear."
