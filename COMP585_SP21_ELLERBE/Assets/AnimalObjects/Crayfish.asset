  description: 'Crayfish are freshwater crustaceans resembling small lobsters (to
    which they are related). In some parts of the United States, they are also known
    as crawfish, craydids, crawdaddies, crawdads, freshwater lobsters, mountain lobsters,
    mudbugs, or yabbies.


    Taxonomically, they are members of the superfamilies
    Astacoidea and Parastacoidea. They breathe through feather-like gills. Some species
    are found in brooks and streams, where fresh water is running, while others thrive
    in swamps, ditches, and paddy fields. Most crayfish cannot tolerate polluted
    water, although some species, such as Procambarus clarkii, are hardier. Crayfish
    feed on animals and plants, either living or decomposing, and detritus.'
