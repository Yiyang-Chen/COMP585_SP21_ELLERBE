  description: 'The coyote (Canis latrans) is a species of canine native to North
    America. It is smaller than its close relative, the wolf, and slightly smaller
    than the closely related eastern wolf and red wolf. It fills much of the same
    ecological niche as the golden jackal does in Eurasia. The coyote is larger and
    more predatory and was once referred to as the American jackal by a behavioral
    ecologist. Other historical names for the species include the prairie wolf and
    the brush wolf.


    The coyote is listed as least concern by the International
    Union for Conservation of Nature, due to its wide distribution and abundance
    throughout North America. Coyote populations are also abundant southwards through
    Mexico and into Central America. The species is versatile, able to adapt to and
    expand into environments modified by humans. It is enlarging its range by moving
    into urban areas in the eastern U.S. and Canada. The coyote was sighted in eastern
    Panama (across the Panama Canal from their home range) for the first time in
    2013.'
