  description: 'The Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus) is a common species
    of wren that is a resident in the eastern half of the United States of America,
    the extreme south of Ontario, Canada, and the extreme northeast of Mexico. Severe
    winters restrict the northern limits of their range while favorable weather conditions
    lead to a northward extension of their breeding range. Their preferred habitat
    is in dense cover in forest, farm edges and suburban areas. This wren is the
    state bird of South Carolina.


    There are seven recognized subspecies across
    the range of these wrens and they differ slightly in song and appearance. The
    birds are generally inconspicuous, avoiding the open for extended periods of
    time. When out in the open, they investigate their surroundings and are rarely
    stationary. After finding a mate, pairs maintain a territory and stay together
    for several years. Both males and females give out alarm calls, but only males
    sing to advertise territory. Carolina wrens raise multiple broods during the
    summer breeding season, but can fall victim to brood parasitism by brown-headed
    cowbirds, among other species. Some populations have been affected by mercury
    contamination.'
