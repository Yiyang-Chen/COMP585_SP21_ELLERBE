  description: 'The barred owl (Strix varia), also known as the northern barred owl,
    striped owl or, more informally, hoot owl, is a North American large species of
    owl. A member of the true owl family, Strigidae, they belong to the genus Strix,
    which is also the origin of the family''s name under Linnaean taxonomy. Barred
    owls are largely native to eastern North America, but have expanded their range
    to the west coast of North America where they are considered invasive. Mature
    forests are their preferred habitat, but they can also acclimate to various gradients
    of open woodlands. Their diet consists mainly of small mammals, but this species
    is an opportunistic predator and is known to prey upon other small vertebrates
    such as birds, reptiles, and amphibians, as well as a variety of invertebrates.


    Barred owls are brown to gray overall, with dark striping on the underside. Barred
    owls have typical nesting habits for a true owl, tending to raise a relatively
    small brood often in a tree hollow or snag (but sometimes also in other nesting
    sites) in forested areas. As a result of the barred owl''s westward expansion,
    the species has begun to encroach on the range of the related and threatened spotted
    owl (Strix occidentalis). Evidence shows the assorted threats posed by the invading
    barred species are only increasing. In response, biologists have recommended culling
    operations to mitigate the negative effect of the barred on the spotted owl species.'
