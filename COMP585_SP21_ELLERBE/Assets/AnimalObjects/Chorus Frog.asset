  description: "Pseudacris (commonly known as the chorus frogs) is a genus of frogs
    in the family Hylidae found in North America ranging from the Pacific coastline
    to the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe name of the genus comes from the Greek pseudes (false)
    and akris (locust), probably a reference to the repeated rasping trill of most
    chorus frogs, which is similar to that of the insect. It could also mean \u2018false
    Acris\u2019, distinguishing it from another frog genus."
