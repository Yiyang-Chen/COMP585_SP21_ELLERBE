  description: "The Copperhead is the most widespread of North Carolina\u2019s six
    venomous snakes. The copperhead probably occurs in every county in North Carolina,
    and is distributed throughout the southeastern United States. Known as \u201Chighland
    moccasins,\u201D copperheads inhabit wooded areas ranging from riparian (streamside)
    habitat to ridgetops. They sometimes reside in more open habitat and are fairly
    tolerant of human development, often frequenting trash piles and abandoned buildings.
    \r\n\r\nThe copperhead is a stout, moderately large viperid (i.e., in the family
    of venomous, fanged snakes) that can attain a maximum length of almost 4.5 feet.
    Adults are pinkish-brown with darker, brownish hourglass-shaped crossbands. Neonates,
    or newborns, have bright greenish-yellow tail tips. They mate in both spring
    and fall, and give birth to around a dozen live young in September and October.
    In autumn, copperheads will gather to den communally along with other snake species
    to better endure the colder months. Normally a quiet, retiring snake, copperheads
    will strike vigorously if annoyed."
