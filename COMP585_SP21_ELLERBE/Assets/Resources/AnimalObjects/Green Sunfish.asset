  description: 'The green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) is a species of Freshwater
    fish in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) of order Perciformes. A panfish popular
    with anglers, the green sunfish is also kept as an aquarium fish by hobbyists.
    They are usually caught by accident, while fishing for other game fish. Green
    sunfish can be caught with live bait such as nightcrawlers, waxworms, mealworms,
    and blood worms. Grocery store baits such as pieces of hot dog or corn kernels
    can even catch fish. Green sunfish are aggressive and will hit small lures. They
    can be caught with fly fishing tackle.


    The green sunfish is said to have
    polarization sensitive vision not found in humans and other vertebrates mostly
    which helps in enhancement of visibility of target objects in scattering media,
    using a method called polarization difference imaging.'
