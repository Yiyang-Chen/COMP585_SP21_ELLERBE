  description: 'The bald-faced hornet (Dolichovespula maculata) is a eusocial wasp
    of the cosmopolitan family Vespidae. It is also known as the bald hornet, white-faced
    hornet, black jack, white-tailed hornet, white-ass hornet, spruce wasp, blackjacket,
    and bull wasp. This species is a yellowjacket wasp, not a true hornet (genus
    Vespa). Colonies contain 400 to 700 workers, the largest recorded colony size
    in its genus, Dolichovespula. It builds a characteristic large hanging paper
    nest up to 58 centimeters (23 in) in length. Workers aggressively defend their
    nest by repeatedly stinging invaders.


    The bald-faced hornet is distributed
    throughout the United States and southern Canada, but is most common in the southeastern
    United States. Males in this species are haploid and females are diploid. Worker
    females can therefore lay eggs which develop into males.'
  shortDescription: A relative of the yellowjacket that gets its common name from
    its largely black color and mostly white face.
