  description: 'The barred owl (Strix varia), also known as the northern barred owl,
    striped owl or, more informally, hoot owl, is a North American large species
    of owl. A member of the true owl family, Strigidae, they belong to the genus
    Strix, which is also the origin of the family''s name under Linnaean taxonomy.
    Barred owls are largely native to eastern North America, but have expanded their
    range to the west coast of North America where they are considered invasive.
    Mature forests are their preferred habitat, but they can also acclimate to various
    gradients of open woodlands. Their diet consists mainly of small mammals, but
    this species is an opportunistic predator and is known to prey upon other small
    vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, and amphibians, as well as a variety of
    invertebrates.


    Barred owls are brown to gray overall, with dark striping
    on the underside. Barred owls have typical nesting habits for a true owl, tending
    to raise a relatively small brood often in a tree hollow or snag (but sometimes
    also in other nesting sites) in forested areas. As a result of the barred owl''s
    westward expansion, the species has begun to encroach on the range of the related
    and threatened spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). Evidence shows the assorted
    threats posed by the invading barred species are only increasing. In response,
    biologists have recommended culling operations to mitigate the negative effect
    of the barred on the spotted owl species.'
