  description: 'The eastern box turtle (Terrapene carolina carolina), also known
    as land turtle, is a subspecies within a group of hinge-shelled turtles, normally
    called box turtles. T. c. carolina is native to the eastern part of the United
    States.


    The eastern box turtle is a subspecies of the common box turtle
    (Terrapene carolina). While in the pond turtle family, Emydidae, and not a tortoise,
    the box turtle is largely terrestrial. Box turtles are slow crawlers, extremely
    long lived, slow to mature, and have relatively few offspring per year. These
    characteristics, along with a propensity to get hit by cars and agricultural
    machinery, make all box turtle species particularly susceptible to anthropogenic,
    or human-induced, mortality.



    In 2011, citing "a widespread persistent
    and ongoing gradual decline of Terrapene carolina that probably exceeds 32% over
    three generations", the IUCN downgraded its conservation status from Near Threatened
    to Vulnerable.'
