  description: The common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) is a New World warbler.
    It is an abundant breeder in North America, ranging from southern Canada to central
    Mexico. The genus name Geothlypis is from Ancient Greek geo, "ground", and thlupis,
    an unidentified small bird; thlypis is often used in the scientific names of
    New World warblers. The specific trichas is also from Greek; trikhas is a kind
    of thrush, the word being derived from trikhos, "hair".
