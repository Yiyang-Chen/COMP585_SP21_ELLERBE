  description: 'The Canada goose (Branta canadensis) is a large wild goose with a
    black head and neck, white cheeks, white under its chin, and a brown body. It
    is native to arctic and temperate regions of North America, and its migration
    occasionally reaches northern Europe. It has been introduced to the United Kingdom,
    Ireland, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, New Zealand, Japan, Argentina, Chile, and
    the Falkland Islands. Like most geese, the Canada goose is primarily herbivorous
    and normally migratory; it tends to be found on or close to fresh water.


    Extremely
    adept at living in human-altered areas, Canada geese have established breeding
    colonies in urban and cultivated habitats, which provide food and few natural
    predators. The success of this common park species has led to its often being
    considered a pest species because of its excrement, its depredation of crops,
    its noise, its aggressive territorial behavior toward both humans and other animals,
    and its habit of begging for food (caused by human hand feeding).'
