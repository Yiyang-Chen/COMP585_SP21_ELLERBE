  description: 'Cricket frogs, genus Acris, are small, North American frogs of the
    family Hylidae.[1][2] They occur in northern Mexico (Coahuila), the USA east
    of the Rocky Mountains, and southern Ontario, Canada.


    They are more aquatic
    than other members of the family, and are generally associated with permanent
    bodies of water with surface vegetation. This is a quite important aspect of
    their survival, as adult cricket frogs suffer high mortality rates when submerged
    in poorly oxygenated water (typically less than 24 hours on average in water
    that is ~1.2 mg/L). The common and scientific names refer to their call, which
    resembles that of a cricket. The two common species are A. crepitans and A. gryllus.
    A. crepitans are found in mesic woodlands as well as xeric grasslands, whereas
    A. gryllus are concentrated in mesic woodlands.


    Cricket frogs are able
    to communicate and attract each other using a specific frequency of their mating
    call, that sounds like a cricket. It can only be heard by members of the same
    population. Cricket frogs from other locales are unable to aurally process other
    calls, leading to mating isolation among the species.'
