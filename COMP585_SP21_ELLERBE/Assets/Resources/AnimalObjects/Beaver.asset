  description: 'Beavers are large, semiaquatic rodents in the genus Castor native
    to the temperate Northern Hemisphere. There are two extant species: the North
    American beaver (Castor canadensis) and the Eurasian beaver (C. fiber). Beavers
    are the second-largest living rodents after the capybaras. They have stout bodies
    with large heads, long chisel-like incisors, brown or gray fur, hand-like front
    feet, webbed back feet and flat, scaly tails. The Eurasian beaver has a more
    elongated skull with a more triangular nasal bone opening, lighter fur color
    and a narrower tail. The animals can be found in a number of freshwater habitats,
    such as rivers, streams, lakes and ponds. They are herbivorous, consuming tree
    bark, aquatic plants, grasses and sedges.


    Beavers build dams and lodges
    using tree branches, vegetation, rocks and mud; they chew down trees for building
    material. Dams impound water and lodges serve as shelters. Their infrastructure
    creates wetlands used by many other species, and because of their effect on other
    organisms in the ecosystem, they are considered a keystone species. Adult males
    and females live in monogamous pairs with their offspring. When they are old
    enough, the young will help their parents repair dams and lodges and may also
    help raise newly born offspring. Beavers hold territories and mark them using
    scent mounts made of mud, debris and castoreum, a urine-based substance excreted
    through the beaver''s castor sacs. Beavers can also recognize their kin by their
    anal gland secretions and are more likely to tolerate them as neighbors.'
