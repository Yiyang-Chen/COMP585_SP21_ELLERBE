  description: "This largest of North American frogs is perhaps our most familiar
    amphibian. The bullfrog is usually some shade of brown or green, frequently with
    obscure dark blotches and often with bright green around the face. Its belly
    is whitish with dark mottling. The lack of ridges running along the sides of
    its body distinguishes it from most of our other \u201Ctrue frogs.\u201D"
