  description: "Rat snakes are the most common large snakes encountered by people
    in most parts of North Carolina. Rat snakes have highly variable color patterns,
    ranging from solid black in the mountains and Piedmont to yellowish-green with
    dark stripes in the Coastal Plain. Intermediate color patterns can be found between
    the Coastal Plain and Piedmont. The young are boldly marked with dark brown blotches
    on a gray or light brown background. As they age, the blotched pattern changes
    to the adult color pattern. Rat snakes\u2019 bellies are usually a mixture of
    white and black checkered markings. These snakes are fairly heavy-bodied and
    are shaped somewhat like a loaf of bread rather than having round bodies."
